                                        In this case study, we're doing research on the <strong>refrigerator</strong>. 
                                        Are there potential issues that refrigerators have? How could the refrigerator be improved? 
                                        Through doing heuristic evaluation and usability tests, the issues would be found and solved.

                                                Refrigerators are a part of our life. Everyone has one at home. 
                                                And we use fridges everyday. Sometimes, we would find the design of fridges does not fit our usage habits.
                                                 For example, the food in the fridge would expire someday. 
                                                 However, users may not remember the expiration date of every food in the fridge. 
                                                 Hence, through this case study, we’re doing research on the refrigerator and 
                                                 trying to find the potential usability issues of fridges and solve them.

                                                    Usability testing is a methodology to test the quality of the usability of a product as well as the user experience of a real life user. For this particular project we decided to create a usability test plan and conduct an imaginary usability test, as it is not feasible to conduct a real-life usability test due to the incredibly expensive cost in developing the prototype of our product. The prototype in which we will be conducting the usability test is designed based on recommendations of improvement that we derived from our previous assignments such as heuristic evaluations and task analysis that we conducted with our users. 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    In the usability test, we would like to ask participants to complete some tasks about the feature of our improvement on the fridge’s touchscreen interface. Each task would cost participants around 5 (five) minutes. Before and after completing the task, participants are required to answer some questions about how they use their fridge, what they think about the new fridge’s touchscreen interface, and if there’s something that needs to be improved. The usability task would cost participants 30 (thirty) minutes.

                                                    For this particular usability test, we would conduct in-person testing sessions with our users. In order to reduce potential bias or confounding aspects that may affect the result of the test, the testing environment as well as the instruction that is given need to be exactly the same for each participant. Additionally, during the test, the facilitator of the test is not allowed to help the users even when users are frustrated. After a given time - when the participant is still not successful, then the tester is allowed to show the users how to do it.

                                                    The participants are required to answer some pre-test questions before they perform the usability test, as well as a post-test questionnaire following the session. As the testers, we will record the steps that each participant took to complete each task. We will also record their “think-out-loud” process to identify users’ frustrations.

                                            Addressing user issues: 
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Barcode scanner to input food expiration date: By scanning the barcode, the smart fridge could memorize the expiration date for users.</li>
                                                <li>Food expiration date reminder: The fridge would remind users that the food’s expiration date is close. Users could set the time of reminder, like a week before expiration date. Then, the system would remind users.</li>
                                                <li>Door timely alarm: Users sometimes would forget to close their fridge’s doors. Hence, the door alarm could remind users to close doors well without wasting electricity. </li>
                                            </ul>
                                            Enhancing user experience: 
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Music player: The system could also play music when connected to the internet. Some users used to cook with music or radio.</li>
                                                <li>Voice Assistant: The voice assistant could help users set up the food expiration date reminder, the temperature, the alarm etc.</li>
                                                <li>Recipe recommendation: Through knowing what’s in the fridge, the system could search on the internet and recommend users to cook some dishes from the ingredients in the fridge.</li>
