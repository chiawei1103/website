                                        This project is an assignment of a visual communication relating course, 
                                        which is called Principle of Visual Communication. 
                                        I’ve done this project on my own. In this case study, 
                                        I am going to talk about one of Garmin’s pages. 
                                        Since I like Garmin a lot, I chose to do the redesign of <strong>Garmin's Blog</strong>, 
                                        which is not as popular as his other websites, 
                                        such as Garmin Connect, Garmin Technology, and Garmin Express.

                                                        Garmin is a well-known sports portable equipment and GPS company. 
                                                        And it has different pages for different purposes. 
                                                        Like Garmin connect is for creating a fitness community. 
                                                        Garmin Express is for users to update maps and software on the devices. 
                                                        However, the <strong>Garmin Blog is not as popular as other pages</strong>. 
                                                        Hence, in this project, I am trying to do the research, 
                                                        try to find the problems of the website on reaching information. A lot of articles are presented on the blog. 
                                                        Whether users can find the article that they want to read is a critical issue for a blog. For Garmin, the searching function and article organization could be the pain points.

                                                Global Positioning System (GPS) technology for automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and sports activities is the specialized field of the company. 
                                                Developed to this day, Garmin not only has portable products incorporated electronic maps and navigational charts, 
                                                but also communications devices combined cellular and GPS technology.

                                                Garmin speaks languages about outdoor, safety, and health. 
                                                Those related words and phrases are expressed in the pictures and the articles they publicized. 
                                                We could also know that the value of Garmin is sustainability by viewing their website, blog, and social media.

                                                    Jakob Nielsen's principles are a type of heuristic evaluation for user interface design. They are called “heuristic” since they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines(Jacob, 1994). The following list are Jakob Nielsen's principles:

                                                    Both problem frequency and severity are crucial when communicating the importance of usability issues. Rating the severity of the problem is less objective than finding the problem frequency. There are several ways to rate the severity. Jeff Sauro compared some popular rating approach and sorted out the following rating levels(Jeff, 2013): 
                                                </p>

                                                        so categorizing related things together could make the finding flow easier. 
                                                        Some users use a search engine to get what they want, 
                                                        then letting users decide how to sort the searching result could help them get what they need quicker. 
                                                        Hence, the combination of categorizing and sorting is necessary for searching.

                                                        Users do not have patience and time for clicking “show more” again and again. 
                                                        Users want to know how many they get and how many they left. 
                                                        By knowing that, users could decide whether to keep searching in this category or type in the search bar directly.

                                                        <li>Titles and tags: In order to differentiate the display of titles and tags, all tags add a gray background. Reducing font similarity could help users distinguish the hierarchy of text. </li>
                                                        <li>Carousel: The top big picture in the original website is just a picture, which could be made good use of. It could be a space to showcase the latest articles and recommend readers what the trend is recently. So, it becomes a slider for latest articles with their tags, titles, and dates.</li>
