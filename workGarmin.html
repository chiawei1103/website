                                        This project is an assignment of a visual communication relating course, 
                                        which is called Principle of Visual Communication. 
                                        I’ve done this project on my own. In this case study, 
                                        I am going to talk about one of Garmin’s pages. 
                                        Since I like Garmin a lot, I chose to do the redesign of <strong>Garmin's Blog</strong>, 
                                        which is not as popular as his other websites, 
                                        such as Garmin Connect, Garmin Technology, and Garmin Express.

                                                        Garmin is a well-known sports portable equipment and GPS company. 
                                                        And it has different pages for different purposes. 
                                                        Like Garmin connect is for creating a fitness community. 
                                                        Garmin Express is for users to update maps and software on the devices. 
                                                        However, the <strong>Garmin Blog is not as popular as other pages</strong>. 
                                                        Hence, in this project, I am trying to do the research, 
                                                        try to find the problems of the website, and improve the website to reach more people, 
                                                        being more user-friendly.

                                                <stroing>Garmin</stroing> is a multinational technology company founded by Gary Burrell and Min Kao in Kansas, United States. 
                                                Global Positioning System (GPS) technology for automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and sports activities is the specialized field of the company. 
                                                Developed to this day, Garmin not only has portable products incorporated electronic maps and navigational charts, 
                                                but also communications devices combined cellular and GPS technology. 
                                                
                                            </p>

                                                Garmin speaks languages about outdoor, safety, and health. 
                                                Those related words and phrases are expressed in the pictures and the articles they publicized. 
                                                We could also know that the value of Garmin is sustainability by viewing their website, blog, and social media.

                                                While doing the heuristic evaluation on the website, 
                                                I found that most of the problems on the website are related to visibility of system status, 
                                                which is about navigation and pagination on the website.

                                                        When it comes to searching things, categorizing and sorting play crucial roles. 
                                                        Some users use categories to find what they want, 
                                                        so categorizing related things together could make the finding flow easier. 
                                                        Some users use a search engine to get what they want, 
                                                        then letting users decide how to sort the searching result could help them get what they need quicker. 
                                                        Hence, the combination of categorizing and sorting is necessary for searching. 
                                                        In the revision, users could either select the category they want or type in the search bar.

                                                        Users do not have patience and time for clicking “show more” again and again. 
                                                        Users want to know how many they get and how many they left. 
                                                        By knowing that, users could decide whether to keep searching in this category or type in the search bar directly.
