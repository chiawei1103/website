                                        This project is an assignment of a user experience related course, which is called Usability/ User Experience. 
                                        I’ve done this project on my own. In this case study, I am going to talk about AZBC’s website. 
                                        Since I like playing badminton, I visited the website several times. 
                                        I found some frustration while using the website. Hence, I chose this website to do the user experience research. 
                                        I will do the heuristic evaluation and user research for the website and create personas and users stories.

                                                        The main goal of AZBC’s website is to provide information about all ability levels of training courses, tournaments, and services, such as stringing rackets, a accessories store. However, I couldn’t find the information well on the website. I thought it was my problem. After asking some people on the badminton court, I found they all have the same issue. They couldn’t find the information they wanted on the website. Hence, I did this research on the website to try to find a solution to the issue.

                                                    Jakob Nielsen's 10 principles are a type of heuristic evaluation for user interface design. They are called “heuristic” since they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines(Jacob, 1994). The following list are Jakob Nielsen's 10 principles:

                                                    Both problem frequency and severity are crucial when communicating the importance of usability issues. Rating the severity of the problem is less objective than finding the problem frequency. There are several ways to rate the severity. Jeff Sauro compared some popular rating approach and sorted out the following rating levels(Jeff, 2013): 
                                                </p>

                                                    <li><strong>Moderate: </strong> Causes occasional task failure for some users; causes delays and moderate irritation</li>
                                                    <li><strong>Critical: </strong> Leads to task failure. Causes users extreme irritation</li>

                                                            There are two types of errors: slips(right intent, wrong action) and mistakes(wrong intent). In this simple website, there are only three types of action: submit a form, click to sections, and search a query. Hence, a slip would only happen when submitting a form. If users fill in the wrong format  in the form, the slip could happen. Hence, the system shows an instruction to prevent the error occurring, which satisfies the error prevention heuristic evaluation.
