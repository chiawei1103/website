                                        This project is an assignment of a user experience related course, which is called Usability/ User Experience. 
                                        I‚Äôve done this project on my own. In this case study, I am going to talk about AZBC‚Äôs website. 
                                        Since I like playing badminton, I visited the website several times. 
                                        I found some frustration while using the website. Hence, I chose this website to do the user experience research. 
                                        I will do the heuristic evaluation and user research for the website and create personas and users stories.

                                                        The main goal of AZBC‚Äôs website is to provide information about all ability levels of training courses, tournaments, and services, such as stringing rackets, a accessories store. However, I couldn‚Äôt find the information well on the website. I thought it was my problem. After asking some people on the badminton court, I found they all have the same issue. They couldn‚Äôt find the information they wanted on the website. Hence, I did this research on the website to try to find a solution to the issue.

                                                    Jakob Nielsen's 10 principles are a type of heuristic evaluation for user interface design. They are called ‚Äúheuristic‚Äù since they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines(Jacob, 1994). The following list are Jakob Nielsen's 10 principles:

                                                    Both problem frequency and severity are crucial when communicating the importance of usability issues. Rating the severity of the problem is less objective than finding the problem frequency. There are several ways to rate the severity. Jeff Sauro compared some popular rating approach and sorted out the following rating levels(Jeff, 2013): 
                                                </p>

                                                    <li><strong>Moderate: </strong> Causes occasional task failure for some users; causes delays and moderate irritation</li>
                                                    <li><strong>Critical: </strong> Leads to task failure. Causes users extreme irritation</li>

In this simple website, there are only three types of action: submit a form, click to sections, and search a query. Hence, a slip would only happen when submitting a form. If users fill in the wrong format  in the form, the slip could happen. Hence, the system shows an instruction to prevent the error occurring, which satisfies the error prevention heuristic evaluation.

                                                For usability testing, the following issues are found from the above research. 
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>
                                                    <strong>Users can't find what they are looking for: </strong> This issue is found by the result of user research. I got several replies from the survey about how they can‚Äôt find what they are looking for. And the way to find the solution to the issue is to do the usability test. By testing the website from different perspectives, we could know how to redesign the website and improve user experience. 
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <strong>The flexibility and efficiency of use: </strong> According to the heuristic evaluation, the issue of the flexibility and efficiency of use is found. When sending email or using google maps, users cannot open the application directly on the website. By doing usability testing, we could know how important the feature is to users.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                    <strong>The typography and hierarchy of content: </strong> From the results of user research, some users have frustrations of the typography and hierarchy. The font colors and alignment is too colorful to read. Some texts are not easy to read while using too many colors. In order to know if most users have the same issue, usability testing is one of the essential steps.

                                            </ul>
